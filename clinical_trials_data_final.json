Changes in sections A-D of the FMA-UE Scale by 7 points or more are considered as efficacy., The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) is a 19 item observational measures. Items comprising the ARAT are categorized into four subscales (grasp, grip, pinch and gross movement) and arranged in order of decreasing difficulty, with the most difficult task examined first, followed by the least difficult task. Task performance is rated on a 4-point scale, ranging from 0 (no movement) to 3 (movement performed normally).

The best result is 5, deterioration - a decrease in the indicator on the scale, Modified Ashworth Scale: MAS (0 to 4 points). Scoring: 0 No increase in tone (the best point); 4 limb rigid in flexion or extension (the worse outcome), Barthel Index.The Barthel Scale/Index (BI) is an ordinal scale used to measure performance in activities of daily living (ADL). Ten variables describing ADL and mobility are scored, a higher number being a reflection of greater ability to function independently following hospital discharge.Each item is rated in terms of whether the patient can perform the task independently, with some assistance, or is dependent on help based on observation (0=unable, 1=needs help, 2=independent). The final score is x 5 to get a number on a 100 point score. Proposed guidelines for interpreting Barthel scores are that scores of 0-20 indicate \"total\" dependency, 21-60 indicate \"severe\" dependency, 61-90 indicate \"moderate\" dependency, and 91-99 indicates \"slight\" dependency., European Quality of Life Questionnaire EuroQol EQ-5D-5L (version 1.0, 2011 in combination with the visual analogue scale). Health State: The respondent classifies his or her prevailing state of health by selecting one of three different levels of problem severity within each of five health domains. The levels are none, moderate and severe/extreme (coded 1 through 3, respectively), whilst the domains are mobility, capacity for self-care, conduct of usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression, ordered as such.\n\nEvaluation: The respondent then evaluates his or her health using a visual analogue scale (VAS). This is a vertical, calibrated, line, bounded at 0 (\"worst imaginable health state\") and at 100 (\"best imaginable health state\"). Respondents indicate where they perceive their present state of health to lie, relative to these anchors., The rehabilitation Routing Scale (SRM), developed by the Ministry of Health of Russia has six points:\n\nThe absence of significant disorders of vital activity, despite the existing symptoms of the disease\nSlight restriction of vital activity\nRestriction of vital activity, moderate in its severity\nPronounced restriction of vital activity\nGross violation of vital processes\nViolation of vital activity of extreme severity An improvement is considered to be a decrease in the score on the scale., A generic qualifier scale can be used to record the extent of the problem for each identified impairment, activity limitation and participation restriction.

To each area, a score 0 (=impaired), 5 (needs help) or 10 (=independent) is to be associated. Areas included are: feeding, bathing, grooming, dressing, bowel control, bladder control, toilet use, transfers, mobility on level surfaces, stairs. Score 5 is not allowed for some of the areas enlisted. The score is calculated as sum of the value achieved in each area. This clinical outcome is used in Italy as part of the clinical practice., Euro Quality of Life - 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) is a standardised instrument that measures the health-related quality of life. It consists of a descriptive system and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension is divided into 3 levels (1 = no problem, 2 = some problems, 3 = to extreme problems). A unique health state is defined by combining 1 level from each of the 5 dimensions. Each state is represented by a 5 digit code (eg. 11111 = no problems on any of the 5 dimensions; 11223 = no problems with mobility and self care, some problems with usual activities, moderate pain or discomfort and extreme anxiety or depression). The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health (from 100 = best, to 0 = worst imaginable state). The EQ VAS is used to convert the EQ-5D states into a single index value, based on reference values available on EuroQoL Group website., The Change from baseline measured after 6-month is calculated as the difference between the two average (i.e. 6-month and V0) summary indices.\n\nThe descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.

The scale consists of 6 questions for which allowed answers are yes (value = 1) or no (Value = 0). The total score is the sum of the values of each answer provided., Number of patients with a depressive mood, as assessed with the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) (Italian validated questionnaire).\n\nThe Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale is a short self-administered survey to quantify the depressed status of a patient. There are 20 items on the scale that rate the four common characteristics of depression: the pervasive effect, the physiological equivalents, other disturbances, and psychomotor activities.\n\nThere are ten positively worded and ten negatively worded questions. Each question is scored on a scale of 1-4 (a little of the time, some of the time, good part of the time, most of the time).

        "Secondary Outcome": "The FACIT-F, a subscale of the FACIT tool, will be used to assess the level of fatigue and its impact on daily activities and function over the previous seven days (Yellen et al., 1997). It is short and easy to administer, which consists of 13 items graded on a five-point Likert scale (0 = not at all fatigued; 1 = a little bit fatigued; 2 = somewhat fatigued; 3 = quite a bit fatigued; and 4 = very much fatigued). The total score ranges from 0 to 52. High scores represent more fatigue. The FACIT-F has showed as a reliable and valid instrument (Long et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2015). This instrument has been also used in hemodialysis patients and in Vietnamese population. It will be used three times to see how yoga-resistance exercise will change fatigue level in hemodialysis patients before and after intervention., The PHQ-9 will be used to measure participants' depression severity (Kroenke et al., 2001). It is a valid and reliable tool for using in the hemodialysis population (Alshraifeen et al., 2020; Thomas et al., 2017). High internal consistency and test-retest reliability has been demonstrated in previous studies (Kroenke et al., 2001; Nguyen et al., 2022). The tool was also validated and used in Vietnamese population (Dang et al., 2022; Nguyen et al., 2022). There are nine items in the scale indicating nine depressive symptoms. Patients will be asked to self-report each depressive symptom that they have experienced over the last two weeks on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). The total score of the nine items represent the scale score, with a possible range of 0 to 27. A score of 10 or above is classified as depression (Kroenke et al., 2001)., Using PSQI to measure sleep quality (Buysse et al., 1989). It has been widely used in hemodialysis population. It has also been validated and used in the Vietnamese population (Nguyen et al., 2018). The reliability and validity of this scale have been confirmed in previous studies (Maniam et al., 2014). It consists 19 self-reported questions to assess sleep quality, frequency and severity of specific sleep-related problems during the prior month. There are seven domains including sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleep medications and daytime dysfunctions. Each component score is calculated and coded from 0 to 3 (0 = very good; 1 = fairly good; 2 = fairly bad; 3 = very bad). The total score of PSQI ranges from 0 to 21, with a higher score indicating lower sleep quality., Body composition includes body height (m), weight after dialysis (kg), body mass index (BMI, kg/m2), body mass (Kg), Body fat ratio (%), Visceral fat level (0.5 level), Protein (kg) will be measured by Using Health-care Box (HcBox). HcBox is a mobile health monitoring system supported by the AI365 (Artificial Intelligence Health Advice Push System), CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system, and WowGoHealth APP., We will use the IPAQ-SF (Craig et al., 2003) to assess physical activity level which will be treated as covariate of outcomes. Patients will be asked to provide information about their time spent on sitting, walking, moderate and vigorous physical activities during the last seven days. The IPAQ was used in the Vietnamese population (Nguyen & Do, 2021). The overall physical activity score is calculated by multiplying minutes spent on activities at different levels including sitting, walking, moderate, and vigorous, by 1.0, 3.3, 4.0, and 8.0, respectively (Craig et al., 2003; Nguyen & Do, 2021). The metabolic equivalent task scored in minutes per week (MET-min/wk) was used as the measuring unit of physical activity (Lee et al., 2011)., Using the 5-item HSE (Purvis et al., 2013; Shams-White et al., 2019) to assess dietary intake behavior which will be treated as covariate. This tool was used in Vietnamese population (Vu et al., 2021). Hemodialysis patients will report their frequency consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy, and fish over the last 30 days on a five-point scale with 0 being \"rarely or never\", 1 being \"1-2 times/week\", 2 being \"3-6 times/week\", 3 being \"once/day\", 4 being \"twice/day\", and 5 being \"3 or more times/day\". The total HES scores range from 0 to 25, the higher score the better healthy eating behavior.",

Steady state period of the treatment period began after three weeks of product use., Participant were asked to take photos of their peristomal skin at each baseplate change. The discoloration area of the peristomal skin was determined using an algorithm. The algorithm estimated the area of the discolored skin (divided into three different zones). Steady state period of the treatment period began after three weeks of product use., Photos of the peristomal skin was taken at each baseplate change. The intensity was determined with an overlay to the artificial intelligence algorithm. The overlay divided the area into ten different intensity intervals: \"Intensity interval 1\"=0-10 …., \"Intensity interval 10\"=91-100% redness. The score was then calculated as follows: 1*(Interval 1 measurement)..+ 10*(Interval 10 measurement). Thus, if the area was within the first interval (0-10% redness) it was multiplied with 1 or within Interval 10 it was multiplied with 10, resulting in a intensity score for the total area. If there is no discoloration the score is 0, and there is no theoretical maximum. A large score equals a high intensity on the skin. In the description of the endpoint (appendix. 1 in CIP), it was to be determined in the inner and outer zone per baseplate change at steady state. However, the algorithm only estimated a total intensity score; thus, the intensity will not be reported per inner and outer zone., Participant were asked to take photos close to the stoma, which was then assessed by a sponsor or health care professionals. They determined the discoloration, erosion, and tissue overgrowth domain by scoring the area (0-3, with 3 being a large area affected), and severity (1-2, with 2 being the highest severity) affected by each domain. Each three domains contributes to the calculation of the total Discoloration, Erosion and Tissue overgrowth score (DET) going from a scale of 0 to 15 (\"Normal skin\" (DET=0), \"Mild\" (DET=2- 3), \"Moderate\" (DET=4- 6), and \"Severe\" (7-15)).\n\nSteady state period of the treatment period began after three weeks of product use., Participant were asked to take photos close to the stoma, which was then assessed by a sponsor or health care professionals. Discoloration is a part of the discoloration, erosion, and tissue overgrowth (DET) score where all domains are assess to give a total DET score, with a min of 0 and max of 15. The discoloration domain was scored by area (0-3, with 3 being a large area affected), and severity (1-2, with 2 being the highest severity) affected and the scores were added together for a total discoloration score (with the max total score being 5). The area is assessed first and if this is 0 then the score for discoloration is 0, meaning the severity is not assessed. This means that the maximum score possible is 5 and the lowest score possible is 0 and the higher the score the more discolored skin.\n\nSteady state period of the treatment period began after three weeks of product use, Participant were asked to take photos close to the stoma, which was then assessed by a sponsor or health care professionals.

The AI accordingly flag's any video recording featuring abnormal dosing for review by the AiCure Video Review team. Upon confirmation of abnormal dosing, the AiCure Video Review team notifies the research coordinator in the form of a \"Red Alert\". Each of these \"Red Alerts\" message will be counted as an event of intentional nonadherence, and the mean number of times a participant may have \"falsified\" medication taking will be calculated and compared against the number of 'normal' doses., The acceptability of the AiCure Mobile application will be through a system usability scale. 10 items and 4 scale points. For odd items: subtract one from the user response. For even-numbered items: subtract the user responses from 5. This scales all values from 0 to 4 (with four being the most positive response). Add up the converted responses for each user and multiply that total by 2.5. This converts the range of possible values from 0 to 100 scale, with a higher score corresponding to greater usability. Scores above 68 considered above average and acceptable, and scores at or below 68 considered below average and not acceptable., Client satisfaction will be measured using a Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8); 8 items.

The p values for the K-M curve comparison will be provided via log-rank test. Life tables will provide the PFS over the follow-up years. Associations between race/ethnicity and survival outcomes (PFS) will be evaluated with univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models by considering other covariates such as baseline clinical conditions, toxicities and up-front therapy (conventional versus IO). Backward selection will be used to select those factors with p-value < 0.2, which will be included in final multivariable models., Kaplan-Meier curves of OS will be generated by racial/ethnic groups. The p values for the K-M curve comparison will be provided via log-rank test. Life tables will provide the OS over the follow-up years. Associations between race/ethnicity and survival outcomes (OS) will be evaluated with univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models by considering other covariates such as baseline clinical conditions, SDOH, toxicities and up-front therapy (conventional versus IO).
