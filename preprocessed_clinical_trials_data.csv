The NASA-TLX is a subjective measure of CWL and is used across many disciplines. The NASA-TLX considers six dimensions-Mental, Physical, and Temporal Demands, Frustration, Effort, and Performance. NASA-TLX scores ≥55 have been associated with reduced performance in numerous settings. NASA-TLX is considered to be the most used subjective measure of CWL. The validated two-stage process with participants performing 15 separate pair-wise comparisons between 6 dimensions of NASA-TLX will be used.

The child will lie or sit in a comfortable position, and the examiner will stretch the upper limb in different ways, in order to assess the tension each muscle imposes when stretched., Jamar is a regular hydraulic dynamometer and is the most widely reported device used to measure grip strength. The child will perform three trials for each hand, where he/she will be asked to squeeze the handle of the dynamometer as strongly as possible. The values shown on the monitor will be noted for each trial., Mirror movements of the hands refer to the involuntary movements of the less-affected hand, which mimic voluntary movements of the more affected hand. These movements will be assessed with the Woods and Teuber scale (Woods & Teuber, 1978), which is a five-point scale describing the degree of mirror movements. The child will be asked to perform three tasks shown in figure 2: (1) fist opening and clenching, (2) finger opposition (thumb sequentially touches other four digits), and (3) finger tapping (fingers are sequentially lifted from the table surface) and after observation of the examiner, the mirror movements will be classified., The ability to identify objects only by touching them will be assessed with a simple test that includes 12 daily objects (e.g., a spoon, a toothbrush, a coin). The child will be asked to touch some items one-by-one, with his/her vision occluded and will have to report the name of the item touched in every trial., Two-point discrimination (i.e., is the ability to discern that two nearby objects touching the skin are truly two distinct points, not one), will be assessed with an Aesthesiometer. This tool has two pinches which can come closer or further from each other. With the vision of the child occluded and the change of the distance between the two pinches, this test can determine the minimum distance that the two impressions can be distinguished by the child, It is an assessment tool to measure the assisting hand performance in children with UCP. It can be used for children aged between 18 months and 18 years, with playful session made of semi-structured activities calibrated on the different ages (different board games). This tool has been identified as the primary outcome measure and will be used at all evaluation times. The assessment is videotaped and the scoring is based on the video. This test will be performed also to the sample of children with TD., It is a valid and reliable criterion-referenced test for evaluating upper limb movement quality in children with a neurological impairment aged 2.5 to 15 years. It consists of 14 unimanually tested items including reach, pointing, manipulation, grasp, release, and pro-/supination. Only the affected hand will be tested and it lasts approximately 15 minutes., Manual dexterity will be assessed using the BBT. The child will be seated on an adjusted chair in front of a two-compartment box placed on a table, one compartment containing a total of 150 blocks. The goal is to transport as many blocks as possible, one at a time, from one compartment to the other with the same hand. The two hands will be both tested starting from the dominant one., NEPSY evaluates the child's neurocognitive development. In the study the investigators will assess four subtests:

The Imitating Hand Positions subtest which assesses imitation and requires the child to imitate, separately with the dominant or non-dominant hand, various hand/finger positions performed by the examiner.
The Manual Motor Sequences set assesses planning and coordination of sequences of hand movements and the child will be asked to imitate five times series of rhythmic unimanual or bimanual movements shown by the examiner.
The Inhibition subtest and the Auditory Attention and Response Set subtest to assess the attention and executive functioning. The child will be asked to name different shapes according to examiner's instructions or point at the right time in a series of words said by the examiner.
The Verbal Fluency Subtest, which evaluates cognitive flexibility in a word production task within a specific semantic or phonemic category., This scale evaluates non-verbal intelligence and cognitive abilities. In this study, the investigators will use the Sustained Attention subtest, which assesses visual attention and consists of repetitive barrage tasks to be performed in a predefined time., VMI is a paper-pencil test used to determine the level of integration between visual and motor systems. The child will be asked to copy different geometric forms shown on the paper within a certain time frame., MOXO evaluates sustained attention and is provided via a computer. The test requires the child to sustain attention over a continuous stream of stimuli (visual or auditory) and to respond to a specific target stimulus., The Corsi block-tapping test evaluates visuo-spatial, short-term and working memory. The child is asked to retrieve a sequence previously seen by the examiner by tapping blocks with the preferred finger following the same order for the forward condition or reversing the order for the backward condition., BRIEF is a questionnaire filled in by the parents/legal guardians and dives into everyday behavior associated with specific domains of the executive functions (i.e., mental processes that enable us to plan, focus attention, remember instructions). Parents rate items (e.g., ""does not think before doing"") on a three-point scale ranging from 1 (never) to 3 (often)., CBCL is a checklist filled in by the parent/legal guardian and aims to identify potential difficulties in behavioural function. The items are rated in a three-point scale (not true, somewhat or sometimes true, and very true or often true)., This test evaluates cognitive function. It consists of 15 subtests which are being administered via words, matrices, figures, objects, numbers., Similarly, with WPPSI, WISC evaluates also cognitive function. The objectives of the test are very much alike with WPPSI-III, but this test targets children of older age. The version of this test will be the latest one available in the language of the clinical partners., This test will be applied to measure the visual-perceptual function. It is a motor-free and individually administered test to evaluate the comprehensive visual perceptual functions for individuals aged 5-21 years. The TVPS-4 comprises 7 tests: visual discrimination, visual memory, spatial relationship, form constancy, sequential memory, visual figure- ground, and visual closure. The TVPS-4 has excellent reliability and concurrent validity with other similar tests., MACS classifies the child's ability from 4 to 18 years old to handle objects in daily activities on one of 5 levels (level I: greater ability, level V: less ability). It is expected that all selected children for this study will be classified in MACS levels I to III: MACS level I (able to handle objects easily and successfully), level II (able to handle most objects but with somewhat reduced quality and/or speed of achievement so that alternate ways of performance might be used) or level III (handles objects with difficulty; needs help to prepare and/or modify activities)., The HFCS assesses UpL function of the impaired hand (ranging from 'does not use', level 0 to 'spontaneous use, complete', level 8) in children with UCP. The level of the child is typically agreed with caregivers., Classifies the bimanual fine motor function in children with CP from 3 to 18 years old. It is a classification of the hand function in children with CP on a five-level scale, whereby level I describes the best and level V the most limited function. The BFMF also offers the possibility to classify the capacity of the two hands separately (figure 19), in contrast to MACS (classifying the performance of both hands together). The classification levels could be determined from short video recordings (< 5 minutes) of three fine motor tasks regardless of bimanual fine motor ability, making the BFMF 2 a feasible classification of fine motor capacity., This questionnaire measures the manual abilities of children with CP (6-15 years old), with a particular reference to the independence in achieving some goals of everyday life, exploring if some activities are easily performed, if they present some difficulties or if they are impossible. It can be answered by parents or children and it requires 10 minutes., The performance of the affected hand-use experience will be assessed with CHEQ. It is designed to measure children's own experiences when using the affected hand in common daily life activities requiring use of both hands. CHEQ is a computer-adaptive online questionnaire consisting of 27 items for children from 6 to 18 years old, and 21 items for the new version for children from 3 to 8 years old, available free of charge via the website (www.cheq.se). Three scales are used to measure the grasp efficacy when both hands are involved, time utilization when performing the activity compared with peers, and experience of feeling bothered while performing the activities independently., It is a newly developed, parent-report measure for children aged 5 to 17 years that will evaluate the participation and environment of the child across three settings: home, school, and community (Coster et al., 2012). The PEM-CY examines the extent to which young people participate in important activity areas within home, school and community environments, and the extent to which features of these environments are perceived to support or challenge the young person's participation., Quality of life will be measured using a condition specific measure, the CPQOL-Child parent report, or for children 9 years or age or older, the CPQOL-Teen (Davis et al., 2009). The CPQOL measures 7 broad domains of quality of life: social wellbeing and acceptance, functioning, participation, physical health, emotional wellbeing, access to services, pain, impact of disability and family health. The answers of the parent and/or of the teenager is on a 9 points Likert scale, expressing the feeling (as the degree of happyness) related to each question., The Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield et al, 1971) is a measurement scale used to assess the dominance of a person's right or left hand in everyday activities, sometimes referred to as laterality. The inventory can be used by an observer assessing the person, or by a person self-reporting hand use. The EHI is a simple quantitative method of assessing handedness, composed of 10 items (e.g. writing,drawing, throwing, using scissors). Handedness is calculated based on activities mainly done with right or left hand: it is the ratio between the difference of the two values divided by their sum, expressed as a percentage. It can range from - 100 (left-handed) to + 100 (right-handed). Only participants of TD group will be tested with EHI., The DCDQ is a brief parent questionnaire designed to screen for coordination disorders in children, aged 5 to 15 years. Parents are asked to compare their child's motor performance to that of his/her peers using a 5 point Likert scale. It provides a standard method to measure a child's coordination in everyday, functional activities. The internal consistency of the DCDQ is high and the results from discriminant function analyses were appropriately strong for a screening tool (Wilson et al, 2000). Only participants of TD group will be tested with DCDQ, Personalized surveys will be administered and will be addressed at all children (both with UCP and with typical development), their parents and healthcare professionals. The survey will be administered in a different moment from other surveys and questionnaires, in that way the intestigators will allow respondents to not be overloaded with other batteries of questions to improve the quality of answers.

Independently to each other, if possible, both parents should answer their personalized questionnaire., The already available brain images of children with UCP, commonly acquired for clinical diagnosis, will be collected. The images will be scored by expert raters by means of semi-quantitative validated scales called MRI Fiori scale, specifically developed for children with CP. This valid and reliable scale enables the quantification of severity of the brain lesion based on its structural MRI appearance (Fiori et al, 2013; Scheck et al, 2014). Moreover, the images will be de-identified and transferred to CSIRO/UQ in Australia and then will be analysed using automated software, producing quantitative measures of volume and cortical shape, and analysed using statistical regression., On each wrist, a wristband with a tracker (ARYS™ pro trackers) will be worn during the AHA assessment and then for 14 days. These trackers record arm activity, and they provide the activity sum for each day. All the children enrolled (both children with UCP and TD) will be asked to wear the trackers every day for the whole day, except for night-time. During the night, the tracker shall be placed on the charger for recharging. At the end of the period of recording parents will have to place the sensors inside a box (previously received during the assessment) and they will be contacted by a member of the research staff to organize the collection of the material.",,Observational,,"For the group of children with UCP:

NCT04675424,"ICU Patients, Shock",Using Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Assisted Pulse Diagnosis Analysis on Precision Critical Medicine.,2022-10-06,ANSwatch,Unaddressed,45,"The investigators track the enrolled ICU patients for 28 days and record the date and cause of participants' death., Pulse diagnosis in radial artery is recorded by traditional Chinese medicine physician and ANSwatch wrist sphygmomanometer at the same time. With the help of artificial intelligence, the investigators will find the correlation/comparison of pulse diagnosis by physician or machine and hope to define which pulse waveform characteristics could predict the prognosis/outcome in ICU patients.","Pulse-induced contour cardiac output (PiCCO) is a cardiac output monitor that combines pulse contour analysis and trans-pulmonary thermos-dilution technique. PiCCO enables assessment of the patient's hemodynamic status to guide fluid or vasoactive drug therapy, especially if complex mixed forms of shock (e.g. septic and cardio-genic). Relatively invasive PiCCO measurement requires the insertion of a central venous pressure (CVP) catheter and a thermo-dilution arterial line. The non-invasive pulse waveform from radial artery in ANSwatch could be one kind of hemodynamic monitor for peripheral circulation. By artificial intelligence, the investigators could define some correlation or comparison in the pulse waveform between PiCCO and ANSwatch., Respiratory variations in the pulse oximeter plethysmographic waveform amplitude have been shown to be able predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients. The investigators use a device [ Masimo corp., Irvine, California, USA] which could automatically and continuously monitor the respiratory variations in the pulse oximeter waveform amplitude (Pleth Variability Index, PVI, unit in %) to predict fluid responsiveness in ICU patients under mechanical ventilation. This time, the investigators want to find the correlation in the pulse waveform from PVI, PiCCO, or ANSwatch by artificial intelligence analysis., Heart Rate Variability (unit in microseconds) represents significant information on autonomic nervous system (ANS)'s regulating function and balance status. The change (variation) of heart rate during short term (5 minutes) is analyzed with the method of time domain and frequency domain to provide the degree of balance and activity of autonomic nervous system. Low Frequency (unit in %) is a band of power spectrum range between 0.04 and 0.15 Hz. Generally, it is a strong indicator of sympathetic activity. High Frequency (unit in %) is a band of power spectrum range between 0.15 and 0.4 Hz and it reflects parasympathetic (vagal) activity. LF/HF Ratio indicates overall balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. There could be some relationship between these parameters and ICU patients' outcome.",Observational,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Daily mood will be measured using 8 mood items (0 = Not at all, 6 = Extremely), with 4 measuring positive affect and 4 measuring negative affect. Positive affect score is mean of item scores, with higher scores indicating more positive affect. Negative affect score is mean of item scores, with higher scores indicating more negative affect., Daily end-of-day assessments will be captured over a one-week period at baseline and every 2 weeks (i.e., on weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 16). During active treatment in the Lumen arm (Studies 1 & 2) or the in-person PST arm (Study 2), this will occur for 3 days prior to, the day of, and for 3 days after a scheduled PST session. For waitlist controls, this will occur for 7 days starting on Sunday of each assigned week. Daily stress will be assessed by the question ""how stressful was your day today"" (0 = Not at all, 6 = Extremely)., Daily end-of-day assessments will be captured over a one-week period at baseline and every 2 weeks (i.e., on weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 16).

For waitlist controls, this will occur for 7 days starting on Sunday of each assigned week. The appraisal items will focus on assessing ""problem orientation"" or the general awareness and appraisals of problems during the day. A main appraisal question asks ""To what degree were you able to accept your problem as normal or an expected part of everyday life?"" (0 = Not at all, 6 = A great deal)., PHQ-9 is a self-administered instrument for screening, diagnosing, monitoring, and measuring the severity of depression. It rates the frequency of symptoms as ""0"" (not at all) to ""3"" (nearly every day) and has been validated for use in primary care. The PHQ-9 total score ranges from 0 to 27 and is categorized as follows: None or minimal depression 0-4, Mild depression 5-9, Moderate depression 10-14, Moderately severe depression 15-19, and Severe depression 20-27. Cronbach's alpha coefficients range from 0.86 to 0.89 and test-retest correlations range from 0.84-0.95 within 48 hours and from 0.81-0.96 at 7-day reassessment. PHQ-9 scores were found to be highly correlated with Beck Depression Inventory scores in the general population (r=0.73)., GAD-7 is a valid and reliable 7-question scale to screen for 4 anxiety disorders: Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Panic Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Social Phobia. A score of ≥10 indicates a high probability of 1 or more of these disorders. Cronbach's alpha is 0.92 and test-retest correlation is 0.83. GAD-7 scores also correlate highly with scores of 2 commonly-used anxiety scales: the Beck Anxiety Inventory (r=0.72) and the anxiety subscale of the Symptom Checklist-90 (r=0.74)., A modified version of the NASA Task Load Index (TLX) measures workload. The TLX rating sheet was administered assuming similar weights for each of the 5 task load items: mental demand, temporal demand (e.g., being rushed), effort, frustration, and performance. The original TLX includes a physical demand item which was not included herein, as it was not applicable for the task of interacting with Lumen. An overall task load index score was calculated as sum of the 5 task load items, each ranging from 1 to 7. A higher overall score reflected greater (unfavorable) demand., UEQ-S is a validated instrument containing 8 items from the 26 items of the original UEQ. UEQ-S measures user experience. From the UEQ-S survey, scale values were calculated by rescaling the survey responses to the range -3 to 3 and UEQ-S total score were calculated as mean of survey responses. UEQ-S total scores <-0.8 represented a negative evaluation, between -0.8 and 0.8 represented a neutral evaluation, and >0.8 represent a positive evaluation., WAI-Tech was based closely on the original 36-item WAI and uses a parallel set of 36 items rated on a 7-point scale (1 = ""never"" to 7 = ""always"") to measure the level of alliance between patient and digital coach along 3 domains: Task (12 items), Bond (12 items), and Goal (12 items). An overall score was calculated based on item means. A higher overall score reflected a greater treatment alliance.",Interventional,,"Inclusion Criteria:

NCT04016987,Type 1 Diabetes,Automated Structured Education Based on an App and AI in Chinese Patients With Type 1 Diabetes,,Automated structured education intervention based on an app and artificial intelligence,Not Applicable,138,A1c reflects the average blood glucose level in the past 2-3 months.,"TIR measures the time where the blood glucose remains within the proposed target range., Diabetes Quality of Life scale (DQOL) is a wildly used 46-item tool for assessing the quality of life related to diabetes in three aspects: diabetes satisfaction (15 items), impact (20 items), and worry (11 items). Each item is responded to on a 5-point Likert scale, with score of 1 represents ""always affected"", ""always worried"", or ""never satisfied"" and a score of 5 indicates ""no impact"", ""no worries"", or ""always satisfied"". Higher total score reflects better quality of life. A Chinese version of DQOL has been translated and validated in the diabetic population from Mainland China and will be adopted in this trial., Diabetes Self-Management Scale is used to assess diabetes self-management behaviors. This scale contains six aspects with a total of 14 items: dietary management, physical activity, self-monitoring of blood sugar, medical treatment, foot care and smoking. Except for smoking, the other five aspects with 11 items ask the number of days during the last week (ie. how many days did you test your blood sugar during the last 7 days?...). One of the dietary questions (ie. days of high-fat diet consumption) is reversely scored (the more days the fewer score), and the rest are positively scored in 0-7 points. The overall score uses the above five aspects of 11 questions, with a minimum score of 0 and maximum score of 77. Higher score reflects better the self-management behaviors., Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA) is used to assess diabetes self-care behavior. This scale contains six behavior related scales: general dietary, specific dietary, glucose monitoring, physical activity, foot care, and smoking. Absolute weekly frequency or consistency of diabetes self-care activities are scored with a 0-7 ranged scale, with higher scores reflecting better performance in self-care behaviors. The internal consistency reliability and construct validity of SDSCA was supported by its psychometric test based on an adult diabetes population. A validated Chinese version of the SDSCA (C-SDSCA) is available for this trial., Patients' diabetes-related psychosocial self-efficacy will be evaluated with the Diabetes Empowerment Scale-Short Form, which was a short form of Diabetes Empowerment Scale developed from the America population with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. A revised Chinese version is available for the Mainland China population. The Chinese version DES-SF includes 8 domains with 1 item for each (i.e., assessing the need for change, developing a plan, overcoming barriers, asking for support, supporting oneself, coping with emotion, motivating oneself, and making diabetes care choices appropriate for one's priorities and circumstances). Each item is responded on a 5-point Likert scale, with 1 indicating strongly disagree and 5 indicating strongly agree. Total score ranges from 8 to 40, with higher scores reflect a better psychosocial self-efficacy., State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is used for assessing patients psychological status. The Chinese version STAI consists of two sub-scales to measure both state and trait anxiety states. Each of the two anxiety states will be measured with a 20-item sub-scale, and each item will be scored from 1 to 4. The total score for both state and trait anxiety range from 20 to 80, with high scores indicating more serious anxiety., Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) is used for assessing patients psychological status. The Chinese version BDI (CBDI) consists of 21 self-rated items. Each item will be scored from 0 to 3, with the total score ranges from 0 to 63, and a higher score indicates more serious depression., the blood sugar level after fasting for eight hours, Systolic blood pressure, Diastolic blood pressure, serum total cholesterol level, serum HDL level, serum LDL level, serum triglycerides level, Height in meters will be measured., Weight in kilograms will be measured., Patients' engagement with the app will be measured in terms of communications with the clinician and the utilization of the smartphone app. Specifically, the number of messages sent to patients, the number of message responses, the number of video calls/phone calls with patients, the number of logs entered by patients, and time spent in the health education module will be collected., Safety-related outcomes including hypoglycemic events, hospitalization, and emergency room visits will be collected at each follow-up time point including the monthly telephone interview.",Interventional,,"Inclusion Criteria:
